### Instructions

_Do not_ modify any of the contents of the `index.html` or `styles.css` files. Your goal in this lab is to __demonstrate DOM manipulation through JavaScript__. As such, directly modifying the HTML or CSS files is counterproductive.

Take five minutes to familiarize yourself with [CSS Custom Properties](https://www.canva.com/link?target=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Fdocs%2FWeb%2FCSS%2FUsing_CSS_custom_properties&design=DAFriiiv6ao&accessRole=viewer&linkSource=document) (variables)Â - they are an amazing addition to CSS. If you are familiar with using variables with SASS/LESS pre-processors, CSS Custom Properties are similar but far more powerful because they are dynamic (their values can be changed during runtime) - and they are built into the CSS language!


## Questions

1. How do I make the `import` statement work reliably?
1. Is importing the css to the js file the only way to access the info?
    1. Why can't the js see the css if the css has been linked as normal?
